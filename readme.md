I'm just hosting it (unnecessarily).


I've asked the original author about what license to use and he allowed me to use the GPLv2.
Therefore consider each file to be licensed under the GPLv2, even if there is no disclaimer inside of each file.
You will have gotten a copy of the license as part of the git and if not, get a copy from `https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html`.

Original author notes:
Source code for the fan-made port of Hydra Castle Labyrinth for 3DS

Anything related to the PSP and Wii are unfinished.

(Yes, it does look like a 3rd grader programmed this.)


The game's originally done by E.Hashimoto (a.k.a. Buster).
